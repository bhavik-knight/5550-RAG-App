Question: What are crosswalk guards?
Answer: Crosswalk guards are safety devices installed at crosswalks to direct the movement of children and pedestrians along or across highways, particularly near schools. They signal drivers to stop by displaying a stop sign (paddle) facing the vehicle. Drivers must obey these guards, as failure to do so may result in demerit points on their driving record.

Question: What to do when approaching an emergency vehicle?
Answer: When approaching an emergency vehicle, it is essential to follow the guidelines outlined in the Nova Scotia Driver's Handbook. You should stop and yield the right of way to the emergency vehicle, which may include police cars, ambulances, or fire department vehicles with flashing lights and sirens. Remain stopped until the emergency vehicle has completely passed or until you are directed to move by a peace officer. Additionally, never follow an emergency fire vehicle within 150 metres, and avoid driving or parking within that distance if the vehicle has stopped to investigate a collision or provide assistance. Always prioritize safety and compliance with these critical instructions.

Question: What are the rules for yield signs?
Answer: The rules for yield signs are as follows:  
Yield the right of way to oncoming vehicles and any pedestrians who may be in your path.  
A yellow or amber yield sign indicates that you must stop before entering the intersection, if you can do so safely.  
A red yield sign means that all traffic facing the signal must stop at the designated stop line or at the nearest side of the crosswalk. If traffic signals are not functioning, treat the intersection as a multi-stop and proceed only when it is safe to do so.
